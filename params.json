{"name":"Bloggy","tagline":"A blog system meeting your requirements.","body":"**Remember: This is heavily Work-in-Progress and far from being a stable software.**\r\n\r\nThis is a blog system I am currently developing. It is focused on simplicity and conventions over configuration. I recommend to proxy the service using NGINX or comparable software.\r\n\r\n## Set up blog\r\nYou need to have a working Go environment installed (v1.5+).\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ go get github.com/mooxmirror/go-blog # download it from GitHub\r\n$ go install github.com/mooxmirror/go-blog # install dependencies, build it\r\n$ $GOPATH/bin/blog -reset -blog=\"example-blog\" # resets your blog folder, starts the server\r\n$ $GOPATH/bin/blog -blog=\"example-blog\" # starts the server without reset\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Folder structure\r\n```\r\n/\r\n  /blog (runnable)\r\n  /example-blog (folder)\r\n    /config.json\r\n    /posts\r\n      2015-12-31.md\r\n      2015-12-13.md\r\n      ...\r\n    /templates\r\n      base.html\r\n      index.html\r\n      post.html\r\n      header.html\r\n      footer.html\r\n    /files\r\n      header-image.png\r\n      favicon.ico\r\n      2015-12-31.png\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe **config.json** file stores basic configuration options like the blog's name, host address etc.\r\nThe blog posts are stored in the **posts** folder. Every post file has to begin with a date representing the publishing date of the post. Every post file has to contain a header marked by `---`. This header has to be in JSON.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
