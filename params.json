It is focused on simplicity and conventions over configuration. I recommend to proxy the service using NGINX or comparable software.\r\n\r\n## Screenshot\r\n\r\n![Screnshot of Bloggy](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3391295/14057173/52c40638-f2f8-11e5-9fda-23c111e96f5c.png)\r\n\r\n## Getting started\r\nYou need to have Git and a working Go environment installed (v1.5+).\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ # download and install it from GitHub\r\n$ go get github.com/lnsp/bloggy\r\n$ # reset your blog folder, starts the server\r\n$ $GOPATH/bin/bloggy -reset -blog=\"example-blog\"\r\n$ # start the server without resetting the blog\r\n$ $GOPATH/bin/bloggy -blog=\"example-blog\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Folder structure\r\n```\r\nmy-blog\r\n├── config.json\r\n├── posts\r\n│   ├── first-post.md\r\n│   ├── second-post.md\r\n│   └── static-power-activated.md\r\n├── static (images, stylesheets, scripts)\r\n│   └── screenshot.png\r\n└── templates\r\n    ├── base.html\r\n    ├── entry.html\r\n    ├── error.html\r\n    ├── index.html\r\n    └── post.html\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe **config.json** file stores basic configuration options like the blog's name, host address etc.\r\nThe blog posts are stored in the **posts** folder. Every post file has to begin with a date representing the publishing date of the post. Every post file has to contain a header marked by `---`. This header has to be in YAML.\r\n\r\n## Post example\r\n```markdown\r\n---\r\ntitle: Happy New Year!\r\nsubtitle: Ideas for 2016\r\ndate: 2015-Dec-31\r\nslug: open-source-land\r\n---\r\n## Hello World from Open Source Land!\r\n\r\nIt is wonderful in here!\r\n```\r\n",
